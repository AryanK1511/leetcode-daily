# Leetcode Every Day

As of `September 14, 2024`, I am in my final semester at Seneca Polytechnic and actively seeking job opportunities starting in `January 2025`.

Today, I have committed to solving LeetCode problems every day until I secure a job. This repository will serve as a way to track my progress and maintain discipline throughout the journey.
